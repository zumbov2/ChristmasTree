# Animated Christmas Tree with `R`
Christmas spirit sprinkled with a little bit of `8-bit`, a big helping of `tidyverse`, spiced up with some `ffmpeg` magic and voil√†: twinkling Christmas trees as far as the eye can see. ;-) 

Whatever: Create your own twinkling Christmas tree with the script [xmas2021.R](https://github.com/zumbov2/ChristmasTree/blob/main/xmas2021.R) and [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg).
